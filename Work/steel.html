    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>I began working at Russel Metals in August of 2012. I was employed 
        with Russel for eleven years. During that time, I held three separate 
        positions in their workshop. I started as a parts cleaner, but after three 
        months I was promoted to be an overhead Crane Operator. After almost two 
        years, I took the position of Saw and Punch Operator. In October of 2023, 
        I was designated as Senior Saw Operator.</p>
