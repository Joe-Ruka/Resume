    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>I began attending Bay View High in 1999. I played freshman football as a starting offensive 
        lineman. However, because of changing interests, I only played for one season. Although, I 
        can proudly say that we were undefeated conference champions that year!</p>
    <p>I was a part of the Math/Science Specialty program, which at the time, was one of the finest 
        high school programs throughout all of Milwaukee Public Schools. I studied and passed, with 
        no less than a "B," classes in advanced algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and applied mathematics. 
        I graduated with Math/Science honors.</p>
    <p>I graduated in the spring of 2003.</p>
