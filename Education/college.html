    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>I began attending IBC in the fall of 2003. My focus of study was in Pastoral Theology.</p>
    <p>The Pastoral Studies Major, in addition to intensive classroom study, included a one-on-one 
        mentorship program with a local pastor of your choosing. Under the tutelage of my pastor, 
        Pastor David Zempel of Martinsville Baptist Tabernacle, I learned the everyday responsibilities 
        of being a pastor of a local church. He taught me how to preach the Bible to a congregation, as 
        well as many other practical responsibilities of a pastor.</p>
    <p>Of all the courses of study I took part in throughout my years at IBC, the most rewarding study was 
        that of the Biblical Greek language. My instructor, John Krinke, was a caring, patient teacher, who 
        even took time out of his personal life to help his students understand how to study the New Testament 
        in the original language.</p>
    <p>I graduated in the spring of 2008. I graduated with honors: <em>Magna cum Laude, The Greek NT Award, 
        and The Bible Proficiency Award.</em></p>
